# Portfolio
This is my portfolio project for Code Louisville Sept 2018 class

what is supposed to happen?
the index.html page will launch a splash page, you will be asked to enter your name, then you need to click a link to enter the portfolio page
the main page shows sticky notes with links to small projects I made for this project and then a few blanks to fill in later

thanks!!
